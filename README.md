## Features

### 1. Square Highlighting

### 2. Checkmate Detection
- The game automatically detects and ends when a checkmate condition is met, signaling the end of the game.

### 3. Legal Move Validation

### 4. Timer

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The chessboard is set up initially with pieces in their standard positions: pawns in the second row and other pieces in the first row.

2. **Selecting a Piece**: To move a piece, click on it. The selected piece will be highlighted, helping you identify your chosen piece.

3. **Valid Moves**: Legal moves for the selected piece will be highlighted on the board. Click on a valid destination square to move the piece there.

4. **Check and Checkmate**: The game will automatically check for check and checkmate conditions after each move. If a player's king is in check and no legal moves can be made to get out of check, it's a checkmate, and the game ends.

5. **Timer**: Keep an eye on your timer while playing. Each player has 10 minutes for their entire game. If your timer runs out, you lose.

6. **Game Over**: The game will announce the winner when checkmate occurs or when a player's timer runs out. You can then start a new game or exit.
